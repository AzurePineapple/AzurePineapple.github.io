                <p>This <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lD4oSmYQCHOlslu9WRKDtViCix3K_2Be">dataset</a>
                    contains Pokémon encounter data from a script (lovingly referred to as a `Shiny Hunting Bot' or
                    simply
                    `bot') operated by the youtube channel
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@40_Cakes">40 Cakes</a>, playing through Pokémon Emerald, and has
                    been
                    for <strong>24 hours a day since the 1st January 2023</strong>. It is expected to run for years to
                    come. The bot's objective is to complete a combination of challenges:
                </p>
                <dl id="challenges">
                    <dt>Professor Oak's Challenge:</dt>
                    <dd>This challenge requires you to catch every Pokémon available to you before you can fight the
                        next
                        Gym leader (the game mechanics that gate progression). This includes evolving Pokémon as far as
                        possible.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Living Dex:</dt>
                    <dd>The objective of the Living Dex challenge is to have one of each Pokémon in your boxes,
                        including
                        each stage of evolution. A three stage evolution Pokémon will require you to capture 3 each of
                        the
                        first stage. For example, you need to capture 3 Trapinch, one to stay as it is, one to evolve to
                        Vibrava, and another to evolve to Flygon.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Shiny Dex:</dt>
                    <dd>The Shiny Dex challenge mandates that each captured Pokémon must be a <strong>Shiny</strong>. A
                        <strong>Shiny Pokémon</strong> has different colouring than the normal Pokémon (see image on
                        right &mdash; The top shows the usual colouring of Ampharos, the bottom shows the Shiny sprite).
                        Each Pokémon has a <strong>1 in 8192</strong> chance of being Shiny.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>40 Cakes has their own explanation of the challenge, available <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kA1_-FhnAQ">here</a>.
                </p>


                <h2>Where is this data from?</h2>
                <p>The bot outputs encounter data to publicly accessible <a
                        href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lD4oSmYQCHOlslu9WRKDtViCix3K_2Be">.csv files</a>
                    every
                    five minutes; each file in the dataset contains encounter data for each Phase (see <a href="#"
                        class="glossaryLink">glossary</a>). Each encounter contains a wealth of data, 65 different
                    values
                    ranging
                    from the date of the encounter to the unique statistics of that specific Pokémon. It is from these
                    <strong>2,036,406</strong> wild Pokémon encounters that our visualisations were created.
                </p>
                <h3>Dataset difficulties</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Old Formatting:</dt>
                    <dd>The earliest iterations of the bot stored encounter data in a far less organised manner, and
                        much of
                        this data failed to include important values such as the date of the encounter, and other values
                        that were critical in creating the desired visualisations. Phases 1-125 were stored in this
                        manner,
                        and as such were unusable for this project.</dd>
                    <dt>Constant updates:</dt>
                    <dd>Due to the constant updates to this live dataset, the largest possible subset of
                        the available data was used for the visualisations at the time of this project's beginning.
                        375 Phases had been completed on 14/05/2024 (when the data was taken). Excluding the data from
                        before Phase 126 yields a total of 250 Phases worth of data, totalling 2,036,406 wild Pokémon
                        encounters.</dd>
                    <dt>Corrupt Data:</dt>
                    <dd>During the development of the project it was noticed that some values were appearing on
                        visualisations that should not have been possible, such as the bot encountering a Charizard at
                        Route
                        101 and a Poochyena at Sky Pillar &mdash; a Pokémon and a location respectively that are both
                        <strong>impossible</strong> to have encountered, given the bot's current level of progress
                        through
                        the challenge. Initial steps were taken to ignore these corrupt files, but it was eventually
                        observed that these corrupt encounter entries coincided with the encounter having <a href="#"
                            class="glossaryLink">Pokérus</a> &mdash; either infected or cured. Once this observation was
                        made,
                        it
                        was decided to omit all data entries with a positive Pokérus status, as a very small fraction (1
                        in
                        21,845) of the encounters.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Dirty Data:</dt>
                    <dd>In addition to some encounter's having corrupt, unusable data, a number of Phase's data had
                        formatting issues in some rows; usually the bot had written an extra value for one of the 65
                        different attributes, resulting in a row that was longer than expected. These datasets had to be
                        painstakingly examined and repaired by hand in a meticulous manual process.</dd>
                </dl>

                <h2>The Seedot Problem</h2>
                <p>Seedot is a Pokémon that can appear on Route 102 in Pokémon Emerald. The rules of the challenge being
                    attempted by the bot stipulate that it must obtain every Pokémon it is able to before each Gym, in
                    its Shiny form. Unfortunately for the bot, Seedot only has a 1% chance of being encountered on Route
                    102, and has only a 1 in 8192 chance of being Shiny. These combined odds mean that each encounter on
                    Route 102 has a 1 in 819,200 of being a Shiny Seedot. The challenge requires that two be caught
                    before the first Gym, as it is possible to evolve Seedot into Nuzleaf before completing this Gym.
                    Fortunately, it is not possible to evolve Nuzleaf before the first Gym, so only two are required at
                    this stage.</p>
                <p>The first Seedot was found on the 7th June 2023, after <strong>3 Months and 20 Days</strong> of
                    non-stop grinding. Unfortunately, this occurs outside of our usable data range, though we have
                    isolated the encounter in the old data, and 40 Cakes has a <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0-ywULZ8lI">video</a> of the encounter.</p>
                <p>The hunt for the second Seedot began on the 27th August 2023, and as of yet has not been completed.

                <p>This is expected to be the longest single hunt, as later in the game more mechanics are available to
                    increase the rate of desirable encounters for low encounter rate Pokémon. See 40 Cakes' <a
